# First Repository Challenge

First git/github project challenge.

## Schedule of suggested links of DIO.me-TQI Fullstack Developer Bootcamp, to check:

[The Markdown basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)




### Some tips on my own:
 
 - Do not create a repository using dot because it may return a cloning error.
 - If you may need it here it's a link on how to delete a repository: [Delete repository](https://docs.github.com/pt/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)
 - if you didn't quite catch the way to create a line break here is a tip: Try to typing shift+enter where you want the line to break.
