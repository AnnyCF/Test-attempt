[The Markdown basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)




### Some tips on my own:
 
 - Do not create a repository using dot because it may return a cloning error.
 - If you may need it, here it's a link on how to delete a repository: [Delete repository](https://docs.github.com/pt/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository)
 - if you didn't quite catch the way to create a line-break, here is a tip: Try to typing shift+enter where you want the line to break.
 - while save .md on windows you may have to enable the option " File name extensions " so you can avoid any return error.
 - if you are clueless of how to enable that function, I'll do a step by step with you:
1. Open File Explorer (open any folder).
2. Click the View tab.
3. Select "File name extensions"
4. File extensions will now be visible.
5. Optionally, you can enable Hidden items.
- if you had any error saving the __repository__ to your computer you may check if your __windows adm accont__ is the same of the github repository that you are trying to clone.
